  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I’m a creative, energetic, and people-oriented person who enjoys a well-rounded life filled with variety and purpose. In my free time, I love staying active—whether it’s going to the playing hockey(or cello/piano), exploring the outdoors, attending music festivals, or spending time with animals. I also enjoy photography, coaching hoockey, and volunteering at a local dog shelter, which allows me to give back while doing something I truly care about.
I completed my high school years at Pretoria High School for Girls with dedication and several school-level acknowledgements. I’m currently furthering my education at Eduvos in Data Science, where I’ve developed both my academic and personal capabilities through a combination of coursework, group projects, and independent research.
Professionally, I’ve worked in a short-term role as a admistrator, where I gained hands-on experience in basic computer skill, client engament and administrative support. This role helped strengthen my technical skills, time management, and confidence in team settings.
Along the way, I’ve been fortunate to receive awards such as Margret Thatcher award, which reflect my commitment to growth, community involvement, and consistently doing my best.
I’m eager to continue building my skills, take on new challenges, and contribute meaningfully to any team or environment I’m a part of.</p>
