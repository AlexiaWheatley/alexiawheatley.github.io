  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm Alexia Wheatley, a passionate and driven individual with a love for learning, creating, and connecting with people. I began my academic journey at Pretoria High School for Girls, where I developed a strong foundation in academics and leadership. I went on to pursue my tertiary studies at Eduvos, where I’ve been specialising in Data Science.
Throughout my academic years, I’ve consistently strived for excellence where I headed up many organisations(activities) and earning Margret Dedication Award. I’ve also participated in various group projects, internships, and volunteer initiatives that helped me grow both professionally and personally.
Beyond the classroom, I enjoy staying active and creative. My hobbies include traveling, volunteering at animal shelters, working on DIY, painting and home design projects, attending music festivals, running, coaching and playing hockey. I'm also an avid fan of tech, food, and spending quality time with people who inspire me.
I'm always looking for opportunities to challenge myself, learn new skills, and contribute meaningfully to the world around me.</p>
